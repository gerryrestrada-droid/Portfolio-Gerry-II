# My Portfolio (React + Vite)

Minimal React portfolio scaffolded for quick deployment.

## Quick start

Install dependencies then run dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Git & Deploy

1. Initialize git and push to a GitHub repo named `my-portfolio` (or your preferred name):

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio setup"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-portfolio.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. On Vercel: import the GitHub repo and deploy (Vite/React auto-detected). Every push to `main` will trigger a redeploy.
